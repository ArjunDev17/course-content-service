# course-content-service
The **Course Content Service** is a microservice responsible for managing courses, modules, and lessons in the EdTech platform.   It provides **REST** and **gRPC APIs** to create, update, retrieve, and manage study materials.   This service uses **MongoDB** as its primary data store due to the flexible and schema-less nature of course content.
